    <h1>The flex shorthand</h1>
    <h2>The flex declaration is actually a shorthand for 3 properties that you can set on a flex item. These properties affect how flex items size themselves within their container. You’ve seen some shorthand properties before, but we haven’t officially defined them yet.</h2>
    <p>In this case, <b>flex is actually a shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis</b></p>
    <h3>Very often you see the flex shorthand defined with only one value. In that case, that value is applied to flex-grow. So when we put flex: 1 on our divs, we were actually specifying a shorthand of flex: 1 1 0.</h3>
    <h1>Flex grow</h1>
    <p>flex-grow expects a single number as its value, and that number is used as the flex-item’s “growth factor”. When we applied 
       flex: 1 to every div inside our container, 
       we were telling every div to grow the same amount. The result of this is that every div ends up the exact same size. 
       If we instead add flex: 2 to just one of the divs,
       then that div would grow to 2x the size of the others.</p>
       <div class="flex-container">
        <div class="one"></div>
        <div class="two"></div>
        <div class="three"></div>
      </div>
      <h1>Flex-shrink</h1>
      <p>flex-shrink is similar to flex-grow, but sets the “shrink factor” of a flex item. flex-shrink only ends up being applied if the size of all flex items is larger than their parent container. For example, if our 3 divs from above had a width declaration like: width: 100px, and .flex-container was smaller than 300px, our divs would have to shrink to fit.
         The default shrink factor is flex-shrink: 1, which means all items will shrink evenly. If you do not want an item to shrink then you can specify flex-shrink: 0;. You can also specify higher numbers to make certain items shrink at a higher rate than normal.
         Here’s an example. Note that we’ve also changed the flex-basis for reasons that will be explained shortly. If you shrink your browser window you’ll notice that .two never gets smaller than the given width of 250px, even though the flex-grow rule would otherwise specify that each element should be equally sized.</p>
         <h1>Flex-basis</h1>
         <p>flex-basis sets the initial size of a flex item, so any sort of flex-growing or flex-shrinking starts from that baseline size. The shorthand value defaults to flex-basis: 0%. The reason we had to change it to auto in the flex-shrink example is that with the basis set to 0, those items would ignore the item’s width, and everything would shrink evenly. Using auto as a flex-basis tells the item to check for a width declaration (width: 250px).</p>
         <p><b>There is a difference between the default value of flex-basis and the way the flex shorthand defines it if no flex-basis is given. The actual default value for flex-basis is auto, but when you specify flex: 1 on an element, it interprets that as flex: 1 1 0. If you want to only adjust an item’s flex-grow you can do so directly, without the shorthand. Or you can be more verbose and use the full 3 value shorthand flex: 1 1 auto, which is also equivalent to using flex: auto.</b></p>
         <h2>What is flex auto?</h2>
         <p>If you noticed, we mentioned a new flex shorthand flex: auto in the previous note. However we didn’t fully introduce it. flex: auto is one of the shorthands of flex. When auto is defined as a flex keyword it is equivalent to the values of flex-grow: 1, flex-shrink: 1 and flex-basis: auto or to flex: 1 1 auto using the flex shorthand. Note that flex: auto is not the default value when using the flex shorthand despite the name being “auto” which may be slightly confusing at first. You will encounter and learn more about flex: auto and its potential use-cases when reading through the assignment section.</p>
         <p><b><pre>In practice:
            In practice you will likely not be using complex values for flex-grow, flex-shrink or flex-basis. Generally, you’re most
            likely to use declarations like flex: 1; to make divs grow evenly and flex-shrink: 0 to keep certain divs from
            shrinking.
            It is possible to get fancy, and set up layouts where some columns relate to each other in a specific ratio, so it’s
            useful to know that you can use other values, but those are relatively rare.
         </pre></b></p>
         <p><b><pre>7.1.1. Basic Values of flex
        This section is informative.
        
        The list below summarizes the effects of the four flex values that represent most commonly-desired effects:
        
        flex: initial
        Equivalent to flex: 0 1 auto. (This is the initial value.) Sizes the item based on the width/height properties. (If the
        item’s main size property computes to auto, this will size the flex item based on its contents.) Makes the flex item
        inflexible when there is positive free space, but allows it to shrink to its minimum size when there is insufficient
        space. The alignment abilities or auto margins can be used to align flex items along the main axis.
        
        flex: auto
        Equivalent to flex: 1 1 auto. Sizes the item based on the width/height properties, but makes them fully flexible, so
        that they absorb any free space along the main axis. If all items are either flex: auto, flex: initial, or flex: none,
        any positive free space after the items have been sized will be distributed evenly to the items with flex: auto.
        
        flex: none
        Equivalent to flex: 0 0 auto. This value sizes the item according to the width/height properties, but makes the flex
        item fully inflexible. This is similar to initial, except that flex items are not allowed to shrink, even in overflow
        situations.
        
        flex: positive-number
        Equivalent to flex: positive-number> 1 0. Makes the flex item flexible and sets the flex basis to zero, resulting
        in an item that receives the specified proportion of the free space in the flex container. If all items in the
        flex container use this pattern, their sizes will be proportional to the specified flex factor.
        By default, flex items won’t shrink below their minimum content size (the length of the longest word or
        fixed-size element). To change this, set the min-width or min-height property. (See §4.5 Automatic Minimum Size
        of Flex Items.)</pre></b></p>
