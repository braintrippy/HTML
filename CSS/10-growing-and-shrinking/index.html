    <h1>The flex shorthand</h1>
    <h2>The flex declaration is actually a shorthand for 3 properties that you can set on a flex item. These properties affect how flex items size themselves within their container. You’ve seen some shorthand properties before, but we haven’t officially defined them yet.</h2>
    <p>In this case, <b>flex is actually a shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis</b></p>
    <h3>Very often you see the flex shorthand defined with only one value. In that case, that value is applied to flex-grow. So when we put flex: 1 on our divs, we were actually specifying a shorthand of flex: 1 1 0.</h3>
    <h1>Flex grow</h1>
    <p>flex-grow expects a single number as its value, and that number is used as the flex-item’s “growth factor”. When we applied 
       flex: 1 to every div inside our container, 
       we were telling every div to grow the same amount. The result of this is that every div ends up the exact same size. 
       If we instead add flex: 2 to just one of the divs,
       then that div would grow to 2x the size of the others.</p>
       <div class="flex-container">
        <div class="one"></div>
        <div class="two"></div>
        <div class="three"></div>
      </div>
      <h1>Flex-shrink</h1>
      <p>flex-shrink is similar to flex-grow, but sets the “shrink factor” of a flex item. flex-shrink only ends up being applied if the size of all flex items is larger than their parent container. For example, if our 3 divs from above had a width declaration like: width: 100px, and .flex-container was smaller than 300px, our divs would have to shrink to fit.
         The default shrink factor is flex-shrink: 1, which means all items will shrink evenly. If you do not want an item to shrink then you can specify flex-shrink: 0;. You can also specify higher numbers to make certain items shrink at a higher rate than normal.
         Here’s an example. Note that we’ve also changed the flex-basis for reasons that will be explained shortly. If you shrink your browser window you’ll notice that .two never gets smaller than the given width of 250px, even though the flex-grow rule would otherwise specify that each element should be equally sized.</p>
         <h1>Flex-basis</h1>
         <p>flex-basis sets the initial size of a flex item, so any sort of flex-growing or flex-shrinking starts from that baseline size. The shorthand value defaults to flex-basis: 0%. The reason we had to change it to auto in the flex-shrink example is that with the basis set to 0, those items would ignore the item’s width, and everything would shrink evenly. Using auto as a flex-basis tells the item to check for a width declaration (width: 250px).</p>
         <p><b>There is a difference between the default value of flex-basis and the way the flex shorthand defines it if no flex-basis is given. The actual default value for flex-basis is auto, but when you specify flex: 1 on an element, it interprets that as flex: 1 1 0. If you want to only adjust an item’s flex-grow you can do so directly, without the shorthand. Or you can be more verbose and use the full 3 value shorthand flex: 1 1 auto, which is also equivalent to using flex: auto.</b></p>
         <h2>What is flex auto?</h2>
         <p>If you noticed, we mentioned a new flex shorthand flex: auto in the previous note. However we didn’t fully introduce it. flex: auto is one of the shorthands of flex. When auto is defined as a flex keyword it is equivalent to the values of flex-grow: 1, flex-shrink: 1 and flex-basis: auto or to flex: 1 1 auto using the flex shorthand. Note that flex: auto is not the default value when using the flex shorthand despite the name being “auto” which may be slightly confusing at first. You will encounter and learn more about flex: auto and its potential use-cases when reading through the assignment section.</p>
         <p><b><pre>In practice:
            In practice you will likely not be using complex values for flex-grow, flex-shrink or flex-basis. Generally, you’re most
            likely to use declarations like flex: 1; to make divs grow evenly and flex-shrink: 0 to keep certain divs from
            shrinking.
            It is possible to get fancy, and set up layouts where some columns relate to each other in a specific ratio, so it’s
            useful to know that you can use other values, but those are relatively rare.
