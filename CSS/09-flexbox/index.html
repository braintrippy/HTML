    <p>Flexbox is a way to arrange items into rows or columns. These items will flex (i.e. grow or shrink) based on some rules that you can define. To get started, let’s look at a demonstration.</p>
    <div class="flex-container">
        <div class="one"></div>
        <div class="two"></div>
        <div class="three"></div>
        <div class="four"></div>
      </div>
    <h3>Flex containers and flex items</h3>  
    <p>As you’ve seen, flexbox is not just a single CSS property but a whole toolbox of properties that you can use to put
    things where you need them. Some of these properties belong on the flex container, while some go on the flex items. This
    is an important concept.
    A flex container is any element that has display: flex on it. A flex item is any element that lives directly inside of a
    flex container.</p>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="item1"></div>
        <div class="item2">
            <div class="one1"></div>
            <div class="two2"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="item3"></div>
    </div>
    <p>This is and example of flex-item inside of a flex-container that is also a flex-container that have 2 flex-items (middle one)</p>
