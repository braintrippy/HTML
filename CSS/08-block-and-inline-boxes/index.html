    <h1>Block vs Inline</h1>
    <p><pre>Most of the elements that you have learned about so far are block elements. In other words, their default style is
        display: block. By default, block elements will appear on the page stacked atop each other, each new element starting on
        a new line.
        Inline elements, however, do not start on a new line. They appear in line with whatever elements they are placed beside.
    A clear example of an inline element is a link, or <a> tag. If you stick one of these in the middle of a paragraph of
        text, the link will behave like a part of the paragraph. Additionally, padding and margin behave differently on
        inline elements. In general, you do not want to try to put extra padding or margin on inline elements.
    The middle ground inline-block
        Inline-block elements behave like inline elements, but with block-style padding and margin. display: inline-block is
        a useful tool to know about, but in practice, you’ll probably end up reaching for flexbox more often if you’re
        trying to line up a bunch of boxes. Flexbox will be covered in-depth in the next lesson.</pre></p>
    <h1>Div vs Span</h1>
    <p><pre>We can’t talk about block and inline elements without discussing divs and spans. All the other HTML elements we have
        encountered so far give meaning to their content. For example, paragraph elements tell the browser to display the text
        it contains as a paragraph. Strong elements tell the browser which texts within are important and so on. Yet, divs and
        spans give no particular meaning to their content. They are just generic boxes that can contain anything.
    Having elements like this available to us is a lot more useful than it may first appear. We will often need elements
        that serve no other purpose than to be “hook” elements. We can give an id or class to target them for styling with CSS.
        Another use case we will face regularly is grouping related elements under one parent element to correctly position them
        on the page. Divs and spans provide us with the ability to do this.
    Div is a block-level element by default. It is commonly used as a container element to group other elements. Divs allow
    us to divide the page into different blocks and apply styling to those blocks.</pre></p>
