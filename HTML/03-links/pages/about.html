    <h1>About Page</h1>

    Absolute and relative links are a tricky concept to build a good mental model of, a metaphor may help:
    
    Think of your domain name (town.com) as a town, the directory in which your website is located (/museum) as a museum,
    and each page on your website as a room in the museum (/museum/movie_room.html and /museum/shops/coffee_shop.html).
    Relative links like ./shops/coffee_shop.html are directions from the current room (the museum movie room
    /museum/movie_room.html) to another room (the museum shop). Absolute links, on the other hand, are full directions
    including the protocol (https), domain name (town.com) and the path from that domain name
    (/museum/shops/coffee_shop.html): https://town.com/museum/shops/coffee_shop.html.
